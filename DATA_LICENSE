The status of the data in this reposity is shakey at best. Consult legal council
before using it for a project. The nation-level data was scraped from Hank Green's 
video [1] by reddit user _sundur [2]. I then converted it into a CSV, JSON. The 
state level data was scraped from the same video by myself. The geoJSONs are adaped 
from Johan Sundstr√∂m's world.geo.json, released under the Unlicense. My portion of 
the copyright, if any, is released under the Unlicense.
